## Welcome!

Hello and welcome! In this course you will learn how you can get your best work done in pull requests.  You'll learn when and how to request a review, how to review someone else's code, and how to respond to reviews. To do this, we'll be playing around with the code in this repository that makes a simple Tetris game.

If you'd like, you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host your Tetris game. Just go to the **Settings** tab of this repository. Scroll down to **GitHub Pages** and select `main` as a **Source**. 

### New to GitHub?

## Pull Requests Reviews 101

Reviewing a pull request is an opportunity to examine another contributor's changes. While reviewing a pull request, you can extrapolate how someone else solved a problem. It's an awesome opportunity to learn more about how the code works and how others solve problems. Reviewing a pull request is a great learning opportunity!

## Step 1: Add assignees for issues and pull requests

Assignees on issues and pull requests let other team members know who is responsible. The assignee oversees the issue or pull request in an accessible and visible way.
